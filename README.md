Project Title: Air Quality Analysis and Prediction in Tamil Nadu

Problem Definition: The project aims to analyze and visualize air quality data from monitoring stations in Tamil Nadu. The objective is to gain insights into air pollution trends, identify areas with high pollution levels, and develop a predictive model to estimate RSPM/PM10 levels based on SO2 and NO2 levels. This project involves defining objectives, designing the analysis approach, selecting visualization techniques, and creating a predictive model using Python and relevant libraries.
